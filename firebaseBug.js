The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the provided options are invalid or missing required parameters. For example, when initializing Firebase with an invalid config object, it can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.  Another issue arises when dealing with asynchronous operations. If you attempt to access data from a Firebase operation before it completes, you'll encounter errors because the data hasn't yet been fetched.  Incorrect data types passed to Firebase functions can also lead to obscure errors. For example, if you pass a string when a number is expected, the function might fail silently or throw an error.
